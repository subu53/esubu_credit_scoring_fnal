This system helps financial institutions:
- Predict the likelihood of loan default
- Make data-driven lending decisions
- Reduce biases and improve transparency

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.)
- Model Explainability (SHAP values)
- Deployment-ready code (Flask/Django-compatible)
- Git and GitHub integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- LightGBM / CatBoost
- SHAP for model explainability
- Git + GitHub for version control
