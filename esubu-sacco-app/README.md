## üìñ Esubu SACCO Story

Esubu SACCO was founded in 2015 by three childhood friends from Bungoma County. With humble beginnings as a community table-banking group in a small rural market, the founders saw firsthand how limited access to credit was holding back farmers, boda boda riders, mama mbogas, and teachers.

Their mission was simple: create a safe, transparent, and member-owned SACCO that empowers low- and medium-income earners to save consistently and access loans fairly.

Since then, Esubu SACCO has grown into a fully licensed deposit-taking SACCO under SASRA, now serving over 8,000 members across Kenya, both online and in-person. We still honor our roots ‚Äî we know our members by name, and we design systems that serve real Kenyan lives.
